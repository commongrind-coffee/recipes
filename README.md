# PourSync Community Recipes

A community-curated collection of pour-over coffee recipes for the [PourSync](https://github.com/commongrind-coffee/pour-over) smart scale.

## Brewing Methods

| Method | Directory | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Hario V60 | [hario-v60](./hario-v60) | Cone dripper with spiral ridges |
| Chemex | [chemex](./chemex) | Thick-filter pour-over brewer |
| Kalita Wave | [kalita-wave](./kalita-wave) | Flat-bottom wave dripper |
| French Press | [french-press](./french-press) | Immersion brewing |

## How It Works

The PourSync app fetches recipes directly from this repository:

1. **`manifest.yaml`** - An index of all recipes with metadata (name, author, ratio, etc.)
2. **Recipe files** - Individual `.yaml` files in each method's directory

The app reads the manifest to display available recipes, then fetches the full recipe file when a user selects one.

## Recipe Format

Recipes are stored as YAML files:

```yaml
id: unique-recipe-id
name: Recipe Name
description: >
  A brief description of the recipe, its origin,
  and what kind of cup it produces.
author: Creator Name
source: https://optional-link-to-source.com  # optional

coffeeGrams: 15
totalWaterGrams: 250
grindSize: Medium-fine  # Coarse, Medium, Medium-fine, Fine
waterTemp: 95  # Celsius

phases:
  - name: Bloom
    targetGrams: 50      # Cumulative weight at end of phase
    durationSec: 45      # Phase duration in seconds
    isPour: true         # true = pouring, false = waiting

  - name: Wait
    targetGrams: 50
    durationSec: 30
    isPour: false

  # ... more phases
```

### Phase Types

- **Pour phases** (`isPour: true`): Active pouring. The app shows a progress bar and pace indicator.
- **Wait phases** (`isPour: false`): Pause/drip time. The app shows a countdown timer.

Note: `targetGrams` is cumulative - it's the total weight on the scale at the end of that phase, not the amount to add during that phase.

## Contributing

We welcome recipe contributions!

### Adding a Recipe

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new `.yaml` file in the appropriate brewing method folder
3. Follow the recipe format above
4. **Regenerate the manifest:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-manifest.sh
   ```
5. Commit both your recipe file and the updated `manifest.yaml`
6. Submit a pull request

### Recipe ID Guidelines

Choose a unique, URL-friendly ID using lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens:
- `hoffmann-v60`
- `four-six-method`
- `rao-spin-v60`

### Quality Guidelines

- **Test your recipe** - Make sure it produces good results
- **Use descriptive names** - Include dose/yield if helpful (e.g., "Hoffmann V60 15g/250ml")
- **Credit sources** - If based on someone else's technique, credit them
- **Be specific** - Include grind size and water temperature
- **Keep phases clear** - Use names like "Bloom", "Pour 1", "Drawdown"

## Manifest

The `manifest.yaml` file is auto-generated by `scripts/generate-manifest.sh`. It extracts key metadata from each recipe so the app can display a browsable list without fetching every recipe file.

**Do not edit `manifest.yaml` manually** - always regenerate it using the script.
